# MPU-9250-ESP32-Library-Calibration
An easy-to-use library for the MPU-9250 that includes a straightforward calibration function and also allows you to customize magnetic declination. The calibration is saved to the device's EEPROM (or virtual EEPROM in the case of the ESP32) so you won't have to keep recalibrating every time!
